You should register for the conference at
https://www.pybay.com/registration/
as soon as possible.

Unlike many conferences, PyBay doesn't give free tickets to speakers,
nor do we cover travel expenses. We do this because PyBay is a
grassroots, community-organized conference and our core mission is to
keep costs low. Thus, we ask everybody who can afford to pay to do so.
However, we recognize that buying tickets and paying for travel can
represent a financial hardship to some, and we really want to see you
at PyBay! If you can't afford a ticket and/or travel expenses,
please apply for scholarships.

More information about financial aid can be found at
https://www.pybay.com/scholarships/

If you're applying for scholarships, make sure to mention that you're
an accepted speaker.  Please contact the scholarships team at
scholarships@pybay.com if you have any questions.

If you have any other questions, comments, or feedback, please feel
free to contact the conference chair, Grace Law
(grace@pybay.com).

On behalf of the PyBay staff, I want to thank you for your submission.
We're really looking forward to seeing you at the conference; PyBay 2017
promises to be the best PyBay yet, and that's because of our amazing
speakers. We're thrilled that you're one of them.

See you in San Francisco!
